# 🧠 LeetCode DSA Journey 🚀

Welcome to the **LEET-CODE** repository! This collection contains **high-quality, hand-picked Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems from **LeetCode** and other competitive programming platforms. It's designed to help both **beginners and intermediate-level coders** systematically master DSA concepts.

> 🌟 Whether you're preparing for coding interviews or brushing up on core DSA topics, this repo is for you.

---

## 📌 What’s Inside?

- ✅ Curated DSA problems with **direct links** to original questions.
- ✅ Solutions in **C, C++, Python, JavaScript, and Java**.
- ✅ Easy navigation by **topic and difficulty**.
- ✅ Contributions from the open-source community.
- ✅ Learning path tailored for **beginners**.

## 🧩 Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from everyone!

📌 **How to contribute:**
- Add problems categorized by topic (e.g., Arrays, Trees, Graphs).
- Support any of the common languages: `C`, `C++`, `Python`, `Java`, or `JavaScript`or any language you know
- Include a **comment with the problem link** in your code (can be from LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, GFG, etc.).
- Stick to clean, readable code and proper formatting.

## 🗺️ Beginner-Friendly Roadmap

To make your learning structured and progressive, follow this recommended order:

```txt
Arrays & Hashing → Two Pointers  
Two Pointers → Binary Search  
Binary Search → Sliding Window  
Sliding Window → Trees  
Trees → Tries  
Tries → Heap / Priority Queue  
Heap / Priority Queue → Intervals  
Heap / Priority Queue → Greedy  
Heap / Priority Queue → Advanced Graphs

Arrays & Hashing → Stack  
Stack → Linked List

Arrays & Hashing → Backtracking  
Backtracking → Graphs  
Graphs → 2-D DP  
2-D DP → Math & Geometry  
Backtracking → 1-D DP  
1-D DP → Bit Manipulation  
```

> 📚 Start with Arrays and Hashing, then follow the arrows to gradually unlock more complex topics.




Each folder contains problems with solutions in various languages, well-commented, and with a link to the source.
